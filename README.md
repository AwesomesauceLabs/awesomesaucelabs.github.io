# About

Hello! My name is Ben and I'm the one-man army behind Awesomesauce Labs. I'm an experienced programmer with formal training in Computer Science, and in my previous life I was developing scientific software for nearly a decade. I started Awesomesauce in January 2019 because I was inspired by the potential of VR headsets (e.g. HTC Vive) to enable new approaches to 3D gaming, art, and design. With Awesomesauce, my goal is to build tools that amplify the creative power of individuals, that is to say, indie artists and programmers like myself.

You can send me a message on the [Contact Page](contact.html).

VRKB is a virtual keyboard that enables comfortable and efficient text entry in VR. The keys are struck with virtual mallets, providing an experience similar to playing a xylophone or a drum kit. For PCVR, this typing method is both faster and more intuitive than the laser-pointer-style keyboards currently in popular use.

VRKB has been submitted to the Unity Asset Store in Aug 2019 and is currently under review.

Prospector allows the user to browse the massive collection of 3D models at [sketchfab.com](https://sketchfab.com) from within VR.

Prospector is currently under development, as of Aug 2019.

## Voxelbrush: VR Sculpting Tool

<a href="assets/images/voxelbrush-screenshot-2.png"><image src="assets/images/voxelbrush-key-image-large-2.png" class="screenshot" /></a>

Voxelbrush is a sculpting tool for creating 3D art in VR.

I decided to put Voxelbrush development on hold in Mar 2019. There was too much competition in this area (VR art apps), and I felt the project was too ambitious for a one-man team.
