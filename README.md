VRKB is a virtual keyboard that enables comfortable and efficient text entry in VR. The keys are struck with virtual mallets, providing an experience similar to playing a xylophone or a drum kit. For PCVR, this typing method is both faster and more intuitive than the laser-pointer-style keyboards currently in popular use.

VRKB has been submitted to the Unity Asset Store in Aug 2019 and is currently under review.

Prospector allows the user to browse the massive collection of 3D models at [sketchfab.com](https://sketchfab.com) from within VR.

Prospector is currently under development.

## Voxelbrush: VR Sculpting Tool

Voxelbrush is a sculpting tool for creating 3D art in VR.

I decided to put Voxelbrush development on hold in Mar 2019. There was way too much competition in this area (VR art apps), and I felt the project was too ambitious for a one-man team.
